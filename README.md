## Notes

- **Permissions**: Some scripts request permissions such as `GM_xmlhttpRequest` for cross-origin requests.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Scripts rely heavily on DOM APIs (`querySelector`, event listeners, etc.).
- **Manual Testing**: There is no automated test suite; install the scripts in your browser to test their behavior.
